# SyntaxArea
A fast API 2.0 fully customisable text editor written in Xojo.

There are several existing options for highlighting code in a text area in a Xojo app but none of them met my requirements:

1. Fully API 2.0 compliant.
2. Well documented.
3. Fast enough to handle documents with hundreds of lines of text.
4. Able to highlight different syntaxes within the same document (e.g. Xojo code within a code fence in a Markdown document).

`SyntaxArea` aims to meet all of the above goals.
